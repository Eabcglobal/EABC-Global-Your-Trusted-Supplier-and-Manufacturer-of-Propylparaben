What is Propylparaben?
Propylparaben is a paraben-based preservative commonly used in a wide variety of products, including cosmetics, personal care items, food, and pharmaceuticals. It works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria, molds, and yeasts, thus extending the shelf life of your products. 
In particular, propylparaben is favored for its mildness, low toxicity, and effective antimicrobial properties, making it an ideal preservative for formulations where long-lasting stability is key. It is often used in products like lotions, shampoos, deodorants, oral care products, and even some processed foods.
